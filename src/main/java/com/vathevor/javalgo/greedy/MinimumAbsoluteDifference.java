 * Consider an array of integers, arr=[0, 1, ... n].

 * Given an array of integers,

 * For example, given the array arr=[-2,2,4] we can create 3 pairs of numbers:
 *      [-2,2], [-2,4], [2,4]
 * The absolute differences for these pairs are
 *      |(-2)-2|=4      |(-2)-4|=6      |2-4|=2
 * The minimum absolute difference is 2.
