 * Mark and Jane are very happy after having their first child.
 * Their son loves toys, so Mark wants to buy some.
 * There are a number of different toys lying in front of him,
 * tagged with their prices.
 * Mark has only a certain amount to spend,
 * and he wants to maximize the number of toys he buys with this money.
 *
 * Given a list of prices and an amount to spend,
 * what is the maximum number of toys Mark can buy?
 *
 * For example, if prices = [1,2,3,4] and Mark has k = 7 to spend,
 * he can buy items [1,2,3] for 6 or [3,4] for 7 unit of currency.
 * He would choose the first group of 3 items.
 *
 * Complete the function maximumToys in the editor below.
 * It should return an integer representing the maximum number of toys Mark can purchase.
