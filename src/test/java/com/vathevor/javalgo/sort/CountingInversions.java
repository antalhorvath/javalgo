 * In an array, arr, the elements at indices 'i' and 'j' (where i < j)

 * In other words, inverted elements arr[i] and arr[j] are considered to be out of order.
 * To correct an inversion, we can swap adjacent elements.

 * For example, consider the dataset arr=[2,4,1]
 * It has two inversions: (4,1) and (2,1)
